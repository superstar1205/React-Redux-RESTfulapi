#### Q. ***What is React.js? How is it different from other javascript frameworks?*** 

React is a JavaScript library created for building fast and interactive user interfaces for web and mobile applications. It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library responsible only for the application view layer.

The main objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM. We can use ReactJS on the client and server-side as well as with other frameworks. It uses component and data patterns that improve readability and helps to maintain larger apps.

#### Q. ***How React works? How Virtual-DOM works in React?***

While building client-side apps, a team at Facebook developers realized that the DOM is slow (The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated). So, to make it faster, React implements a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in Javascript. So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it. Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browsers DOM.

Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements. The reason for this is that JavaScript is very fast and it is worth keeping a DOM tree in it to speedup its manipulation.

#### Q. ***What are Components in React?***

<img src="assets/component-tree.png" alt="Components Tree" width="600px" />

Components are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. Simply put, a component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs i.e. properties(props) and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.

A react application is made of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a small, reusable piece of HTML. Components can be nested within other components to allow complex applications to be built out of simple building blocks. A component may also maintain internal state – for example, a TabList component may store a variable corresponding to the currently open tab.

*Example*: Class Component
```js
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}
```

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Q. ***List some of the major advantages and limitations of React?***

<img src="assets/react-features.png" alt="React-Features" width="500px" />

**Advantages**  

* It relies on a virtual-dom to know what is really changing in UI and will re-render only what has really changed, hence better performance wise
* JSX makes components/blocks code readable. It displays how components are plugged or combined with.
* React data binding establishes conditions for creation dynamic applications.
* Prompt rendering. Using comprises methods to minimise number of DOM operations helps to optimise updating process and accelerate it.
Testable. React native tools are offered for testing, debugging code.
* SEO-friendly. React presents the first-load experience by server side rendering and connecting event-handlers on the side of the user:   
    * React.renderComponentToString is called on the server. 
    * React.renderComponent() is called on the client side. 
    * React preserves markup rendered on the server side, attaches event handlers.  

**Limitations**  

* Learning curve. Being not full-featured framework it is requered in-depth knowledge for integration user interface free library into MVC framework.
* View-orientedness is one of the cons of ReactJS. It should be found 'Model' and 'Controller' to resolve 'View' problem.
* Not using isomorphic approach to exploit application leads to search engines indexing problems.

</div>

#### Q. ***What is JSX and how JSX can help applications in React.js?***

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any `createElement()` or `appendChild()` methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements. React uses JSX for templating instead of regular JavaScript. It is not necessary to use it, however, following are some pros that come with it.

* It is faster because it performs optimization while compiling code to JavaScript.
* It is also type-safe and most of the errors can be caught during compilation.
* It makes it easier and faster to write templates.

Example:
```js
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {

   render() {
      return (
         <div>
            Hello World!
         </div>
      );
   }
}
export default App;
```

</div>

#### Q. ***What is ReactDOM?***

`ReactDOM()` is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page. ReactDOM provides the developers with an API containing following methods and a few more.

* render()
* findDOMNode()
* unmountComponentAtNode()
* hydrate()
* createPortal()

React DOM is the glue between React and the DOM. When u want to show your react component on DOM u need to use this ReactDOM.render(); from React Dom.

Before **v0.14** React Dom was part of React. The reason React and ReactDOM were split into two libraries was due to the arrival of React Native. React contains functionality utilised in web and mobile apps. ReactDOM functionality is utilised only in web apps.
ReactDOM uses observables thus provides an efficient way of DOM handling. ReactDOM can be used in both client-side and server-side.

Example: 

```js
// index.js

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App/App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

To use the ReactDOM in any React web app we must first import ReactDOM from the react-dom package by using the following code snippet:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
```
**a.) ReactDOM.render() Function**  

This function is used to render a single React Component or several Components wrapped together in a Component or a div element. This function uses the efficient methods of React for updating the DOM by being able to change only a subtree, efficient diff methods etc.
This function returns a reference to the component or null if a stateless component was rendered.

`ReactDOM.render()` replaces the child of the given container if any. It uses highly efficient diff algorithm and can modify any subtree of the DOM.

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(element, container, callback)
```

* **element**: This parameter expects a JSX expression or a React Element to be rendered.
* **container**: This parameter expects the container in which the element has to be rendered.
* **callback**: This is an optional parameter that expects a function that is to be executed once the render is complete.

**b.) findDOMNode() Function**  

This function is generally used to get the DOM node where a particular React component was rendered. This method is very less used as the following can be done adding a ref attribute to each component itself.

`findDOMNode()` function can only be implemented upon mounted components thus Functional components can not be used in findDOMNode() method.

```jsx
ReactDOM.findDOMNode(component)
```

This method takes a single parameter component which expects a React Component to be searched in the Browser DOM. This function returns the DOM node where the component was rendered on success otherwise null.

**c.) unmountComponentAtNode() Function**  

This function is used to unmount or remove the React Component that was rendered to a particular container. 

```jsx
ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container)
```
This method takes a single parameter container which expects the DOM container from which the React component has to be removed. This function returns true on success otherwise false.

**d.) hydrate() Function**  

This method is equivalent to the render() method but is implemented while using server-side rendering.

```jsx
ReactDOM.hydrate(element, container, callback)
```

* **element**: This parameter expects a JSX expression or a React Component to be rendered.
* **container**: This parameter expects the container in which the element has to be rendered.
* **callback**: This is an optional parameter that expects a function that is to be executed once the render is complete.

This function attempts to attach event listeners to the existing markup and returns a reference to the component or null if a stateless component was rendered.

**e.) createPortal() Function**  

Usually, when an element is returned from a component\'s render method, it\'s mounted on the DOM as a child of the nearest parent node which in some cases may not be desired. Portals allow us to render a component into a DOM node that resides outside the current DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

```jsx
ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)
```

* **child**: This parameter expects a JSX expression or a React Component to be rendered.
* **container**: This parameter expects the container in which the element has to be rendered.

#### Q. ***What is the difference between ReactDOM and React?***

```js
import React from 'react'; /* importing react */
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; /* importing react-dom */

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return <div>Hello World</div>;
  }
});

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, node);

```
**React** package contains: `React.createElement()`, `React.createClass()`, `React.Component()`, `React.PropTypes()`, `React.Children()`

**ReactDOM** package contains: `ReactDOM.render()`, `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode()`, `ReactDOM.findDOMNode()`, and react-dom/server that including: `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.

The ReactDOM module exposes DOM-specific methods, while React has the core tools intended to be shared by React on different platforms (e.g. React Native).

</div>

#### Q. ***What are the differences between a class component and functional component?***

**Functional Components**  

* Functional components are basic JavaScript functions. These are typically arrow functions but can also be created with the regular  function keyword.
* Sometimes referred to as `stateless` components as they simply accept data and display them in some form; that is they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.
* React lifecycle methods (for example, `componentDidMount()`) cannot be used in functional components.
* There is no render method used in functional components.
* These are mainly responsible for UI and are typically presentational only (For example, a Button component).
* Functional components can accept and use props.
* Functional components should be favored if you do not need to make use of React state.

Example:
```js
const ClockUsingHooks = props => {
    const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date())

    const changeTime = () => {
        setTime(new Date())
    }

    useEffect(() => {
        const tick = setInterval(() => {
            changeTime()
        }, 1000)
        return () => clearInterval(tick)
    })
    return (
        <div className="clock">
            <h1>Hello! This is a function component clock.</h1>
            <h2>It is {time.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
        </div>
    )
}

export default ClockUsingHooks
```

**Class Components**  

* Class components make use of ES6 class and extend the Component class in React.
* Sometimes called `stateful` components as they tend to implement logic and state.
* React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for example, `componentDidMount()`).
* We pass `props` down to class components and access them with `this.props`.
* Class-based components can have `refs` to underlying DOM nodes.
* Class-based components can use `shouldComponentUpdate()` and `PureComponent()` performance optimisation techniques.

Example:
```js
class ClockUsingClass extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        this.state = { date: new Date() }
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        this.time = setInterval(() => {
            this.changeTime()
        }, 1000)
    }

    componentWillUnmount() {
        clearInterval(this.time)
    }

    changeTime() {
        this.setState({ date: new Date() })
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="clock">
                <h1>Hello! This is a class component clock.</h1>
                <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
            </div>
        )
    }
}

export default ClockUsingClass
```

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Q. ***What is the difference between state and props?***

**State**  

This is data maintained inside a component. It is local or owned by that specific component. The component itself will update the state using the `setState()` function.

Example:
```js
class Employee extends React.Component {
    constructor() {
        this.state = {
            id: 1,
            name: "Alex"
        };  
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
              <p>{this.state.id}</p>
              <p>{this.state.name}</p>
            </div>
        );  
    }
}

export default Employee
```

**Props**  

Data passed in from a parent component. `props` are read-only in the child component that receives them. However, callback functions can also be passed, which can be executed inside the child to initiate an update.

Example:
```js
class ParentComponent extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <ChildComponent name="First Child" />
        );  
    }
}

const ChildComponent = (props) => {
    return <p>{props.name}</p>;
};
```

**Difference between State and Props**  

|Props                             |State                             |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|Props are read-only.              |State changes can be asynchronous.|
|Props are immutable.              |State is mutable.                 |
|Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.|	State holds information about the components.|
|Props can be accessed by the child component.    |State cannot be accessed by child components.|
|Props are used to communicate between components.|States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component.|
|Stateless component can have Props.            |Stateless components cannot have State.|
|Props make components reusable.                 |State cannot make components reusable.|
|Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.|The State is internal and controlled by the React Component itself.|

#### Q. ***How would you create Higher Order Components (HOCs) in React.js?***

<img src="assets/Higher-Order-Components.jpg" alt="Higher Order Components" width="500px" />

A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. A higher-order component (HOC) is the advanced technique in React.js for reusing a component logic. Higher-Order Components are not part of the React API. They are the pattern that emerges from React\'s compositional nature. The component transforms props into UI, and a higher-order component converts a component into another component. The examples of HOCs are Redux\'s connect and Relay\'s createContainer.

```js
// HOC.js

import React, {Component} from 'react';

export default function Hoc(HocComponent){
    return class extends Component{
        render(){
            return (
                <div>
                    <HocComponent></HocComponent>
                </div>

            );
        }
    }
}
```

```js
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Hoc from './HOC';

class App extends Component {
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Higher-Order Component Example!
      </div>
    )
  }
}
App = Hoc(App);
export default App;
```

*Notes*

* We do not modify or mutate components. We create new ones.
* A HOC is used to compose components for code reuse.
* A HOC is a pure function. It has no side effects, returning only a new component.

</div>

#### Q. ***What is PureComponent?***

**Pure Components** in React are the components which do not re-renders when the value of state and props has been updated with the same values. If the value of the previous state or props and the new state or props is the same, the component is not re-rendered. Pure Components restricts the re-rendering ensuring the higher performance of the Component

**Features of React Pure Components**

* Prevents re-rendering of Component if props or state is the same
* Takes care of `shouldComponentUpdate()` implicitly
* `State()` and `Props` are Shallow Compared
* Pure Components are more performant in certain cases

Similar to Pure Functions in JavaScript, a React component is considered a Pure Component if it renders the same output for the same state and props value. React provides the `PureComponent` base class for these class components. Class components that extend the `React.PureComponent` class are treated as pure components.

It is the same as Component except that Pure Components take care of `shouldComponentUpdate()` by itself, it does the *shallow comparison* on the state and props data. If the previous state and props data is the same as the next props or state, the component is not Re-rendered.

React Components re-renders in the following scenarios:

1. `setState()` is called in Component
1. `props` values are updated
1. `this.forceUpdate()` is called

In the case of Pure Components, the React components do not re-render blindly without considering the updated values of React `props` and `state`. If updated values are the same as previous values, render is not triggered.

**Stateless Component**
```js
import { pure } from 'recompose';

export default pure ( (props) => {

   return 'Stateless Component Example';
})
```

**Stateful Component**
```js
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';

export default class Test extends PureComponent{
   render() {
      return 'Stateful Component Example';
   }
}
``` 

Example
```js
class Test extends React.PureComponent {
   constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
         taskList: [
            { title: 'Excercise'},
            { title: 'Cooking'},
            { title: 'Reacting'},
         ]
      };
   }
   componentDidMount() {
      setInterval(() => {
         this.setState((oldState) => {
            return { taskList: [...oldState.taskList] }
         });
      }, 1000);
   }
   render() {
      console.log("TaskList render() called");
      return (<div>
         {this.state.taskList.map((task, i) => {
            return (<Task
               key={i}
               title={task.title}
            />);
         })}
      </div>);
   }
}
class Task extends React.Component {
   render() {
      console.log("task added");
      return (<div>
         {this.props.title}
      </div>);
   }
}
ReactDOM.render(<Test />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

</div>

#### Q. ***Why to use PureComponent? When to use PureComponent over Component?***

Both functional-based and class-based components have the same downside: they always re-render when their parent component re-renders even if the props do not change.

Also, class-based components always re-render when its state is updated (`this.setState()` is called) even if the new state is equal to the old state. Moreover, when a parent component re-renders, all of its children are also re-rendered, and their children too, and so on.

That behaviour may mean a lot of wasted re-renderings. Indeed, if our component only depends on its props and state, then it shouldn’t re-render if neither of them changed, no matter what happened to its parent component.

That is precisely what PureComponent does - it stops the vicious re-rendering cycle. PureComponent does not re-render unless its props and state change.

**When to use PureComponent**  

* We want to avoid re-rendering cycles of component when its props and state are not changed, and
* The state and props of component are immutable, and
* We do not plan to implement own `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.

On the other hand, we should not use `PureComponent()` as a base component if:

* props or state are not immutable, or
* Plan to implement own `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.

#### Q. ***How Virtual-DOM is more efficient than Dirty checking?***

<img src="assets/virtualdom-vs-realdom.png" alt="Virtual DOM" with="500px" />

**React Virtual DOM**  

In React, Each time the DOM updates or data of page changes, a new Virtual DOM representation of the user interface is made. It is just a lightweight copy or DOM.

Virtual DOM in React has almost same properties like a real DOM, but it can not directly change the content on the page. Working with Virtual DOM is faster as it does not update anything on the screen at the same time. In a simple way, Working with Virtual DOM is like working with a copy of real DOM nothing more than that. 

Updating virtual DOM in ReactJS is faster because ReactJS uses

1. It is efficient diff algorithm.
1. It batched update operations
1. It efficient update of sub tree only
1. It uses observable instead of dirty checking to detect change

**How Virtual DOM works in React**  

When we render a JSX element, each virtual DOM updates. This approach updates everything very quickly. Once the Virtual DOM updates, React matches the virtual DOM with a virtual DOM copy that was taken just before the update. By Matching the new virtual DOM with pre-updated version, React calculates exactly which virtual DOM has changed. This entire process is called **diffing**.

When React knows which virtual DOM has changed, then React updated those objects. and only those object, in the real DOM. React only updates the necessary parts of the DOM. React\'s reputation for performance comes largely from this innovation.

In brief, here is what happens when we update the DOM in React:

1. The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
1. The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React matches out which objects have changed.
1. The changed objects and the changed objects only get updated on the real DOM.
1. Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change finally.

#### Q. ***Why is setState() in React async instead of sync?***

Even if state is updated synchronously, props are not, it mens we do not know props until it re-render the parent component. The objects provided by React (`state`, `props`, `refs`) are consistent with each other and if you introduce a synchronous setState you could introduce some bugs.

`setState()` does not immediately mutate `this.state()` but creates a pending state transition. Accessing `this.state()` after calling this method can potentially return the existing value. There is no guarantee of synchronous operation of calls to `setState()` and calls may be batched for performance gains.

This is because setState() alters the state and causes rerendering. This can be an expensive operation and making it synchronous might leave the browser unresponsive. Thus the setState() calls are asynchronous as well as batched for better UI experience and performance.

#### Q. ***What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?***

In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.

**Controlled Components**  

In a controlled component, the form data is handled by the state within the component. The state within the component serves as “the single source of truth” for the input elements that are rendered by the component.

Example:
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
    state = {
        message: ''
    }
    updateMessage = (newText) => {
        console.log(newText);
        this.setState(() => ({
            message: newText
        }));
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <div className="container">
                    <input type="text"
                        placeholder="Your message here.."
                        value={this.state.message}
                        onChange={(event) => this.updateMessage(event.target.value)}
                    />
                    <p>the message is: {this.state.message}</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default App;
```
**Uncontrolled Components**  

Uncontrolled components act more like traditional HTML form elements. The data for each input element is stored in the DOM, not in the component. Instead of writing an event handler for all of your state updates, It uses `ref` to retrieve values from the DOM. `Refs` provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {

    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
        this.input = React.createRef();
    }
    handleChange = (newText) => {
        console.log(newText);
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <div className="container">
                    <input type="text"
                        placeholder="Your message here.."
                        ref={this.input}
                        onChange={(event) => this.handleChange(event.target.value)}
                    />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
export default App;
```

</div>

#### Q. ***What is React.cloneElement?***

The `React.cloneElement()` function returns a copy of a specified element. Additional props and children can be passed on in the function. This function is used when a parent component wants to add or modify the prop(s) of its children.

```js
React.cloneElement(element, [props], [...children])
```
The react.cloneElement() method accepts three arguments.

* element: Element we want to clone.
* props: props we need to pass to the cloned element.
* children: we can also pass children to the cloned element (passing new children replaces the old children).

Example
```js
import React from 'react';

export default class App extends React.Component {

  // rendering the parent and child component
  render() {
    return (
      <ParentComp>
        <MyButton/>
        <br></br>
        <MyButton/>
      </ParentComp>
    )
  }
}
// The parent component
class ParentComp extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // The new prop to the added.
    let newProp = 'red';
      // Looping over the parent's entire children,
      // cloning each child, adding a new prop.
    return (
      <div>
        {React.Children.map(this.props.children,
          child => {
            return React.cloneElement(child,
            {newProp}, null);
        })}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
// The child component
class MyButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <button style =
    {{ color: this.props.newProp }}>
    Hello World!</button>
  }
}
```

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Q. ***When we should use React.cloneElement vs this.props.children?***

The `React.cloneElement()` works if child is a single React element.

For almost everything `{this.props.children}` is used. Cloning is useful in some more advanced scenarios, where a parent sends in an element and the child component needs to change some props on that element or add things like `ref` for accessing the actual DOM element.

**React.Children**  

Since `{this.props.children}` can have one element, multiple elements, or none at all, its value is respectively a single child node, an array of child nodes or undefined. Sometimes, we want to transform our children before rendering them — for example, to add additional props to every child. If we wanted to do that, we\'d have to take the possible types of `this.props.children` into account. For example, if there is only one child, we can not map it.

Example:

```js
class Example extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return <div>
      <div>Children ({this.props.children.length}):</div>
      {this.props.children}
    </div>;
  }
}

class Widget extends React.Component {

  render() {
    return <div>
      <div>First <code>Example</code>:</div>
      <Example>
        <div>1</div>
        <div>2</div>
        <div>3</div>
      </Example>
      <div>Second <code>Example</code> with different children:</div>
      <Example>
        <div>A</div>
        <div>B</div>
      </Example>
    </div>;
  }
}
```
Output
```
First Example:
Children (3):
1
2
3
Second Example with different children:
Children (2):
A
B
```
`children` is a special property of React components which contains any child elements defined within the component, e.g. the `<div>` inside Example above. `{this.props.children}` includes those children in the rendered result.

</div>

#### Q. ***What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is its purpose?***

A callback function which will be invoked when `setState()` has finished and the component is re-rendered.

The `setState()` is asynchronous, which is why it takes in a second callback function. Typically it\'s best to use another lifecycle method rather than relying on this callback function, but it is good to know it exists.

```js
this.setState(
  { username: 'Alex' },
  () => console.log('setState has finished and the component has re-rendered.')
)
```
The `setState()` will always lead to a re-render unless `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns false. To avoid unnecessary renders, calling `setState()` only when the new state differs from the previous state makes sense and can avoid calling `setState()` in an infinite loop within certain lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate()`.

<div align="right">
    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Q. ***What is useState() in React?***

The `useState()` is a Hook that allows to have state variables in functional components.

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const handleIncrease = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  const handleDecrease = () => {
    setCount(count - 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <hr />
      <div>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleIncrease}>
          Increase
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleDecrease}>
          Decrease
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
The useState() function takes as argument a value for the initial state. In this case, the count starts out with 0. In addition, the hook returns an array of two values: **count** and **setCount**. It\'s up to you to name the two values, because they are `destructured from the returned array` where renaming is allowed.

    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Q. ***What is useReducer() in React?***

It accepts a reducer function with the application initial state, returns the current application state, then dispatches a function.

Although `useState()` is a Basic Hook and `useReducer()` is an Additional Hook, `useState()` is actually implemented with `useReducer()`. This means `useReducer()` is primitive and we can use `useReducer()` for everything can do with useState(). Reducer is so powerful that it can apply for various use cases.

Example:
```js
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = 0;
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action) {
    case 'increment': return state + 1;
    case 'decrement': return state - 1;
    case 'reset': return 0;
    default: throw new Error('Unexpected action');
  }
};

const ReducerExample = () => {
  const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <div>
      {count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('increment')}>+1</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('decrement')}>-1</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch('reset')}>reset</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ReducerExample;
```
Here, we first define an initialState and a reducer. When a user clicks a button, it will dispatch an action which updates the count and the updated count will be displayed. We could define as many actions as possible in the reducer, but the limitation of this pattern is that actions are finite.

#### Q. ***What is useContext() in React?***

The React Context API allows to easily access data at different levels of the component tree, without having to pass data down through `props`.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

// Create a Context
const NumberContext = React.createContext();
// It returns an object with 2 values:
// { Provider, Consumer }

function App() {
  // Use the Provider to make a value available to all
  // children and grandchildren
  return (
    <NumberContext.Provider value={10}>
      <div>
        <Display />
      </div>
    </NumberContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Display() {
  const value = useContext(NumberContext);
  return <div>The answer is {value}.</div>;
}
```

</div>

#### Q. ***What is useRef() in React?***

#### Q. ***What is useHooks() in React?***

#### Q. ***What is difference between useEffect() vs componentDidMount()?***

In react when we use class based components we get access to lifecycle methods(like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdat, etc). But when we want use a functional component and also we want to use lifecycle methods, then using useEffect() we can implement those lifecycle methods.

The `componentDidMount()` and `useEffect()` run after the mount. However useEffect() runs after the paint has been committed to the screen as opposed to before. This means we would get a flicker if needed to read from the DOM, then synchronously set state to make new UI.

The `useLayoutEffect()` was designed to have the same timing as componentDidMount(). So `useLayoutEffect(fn, [])` is a much closer match to componentDidMount() than useEffect(fn, []) -- at least from a timing standpoint.

```js
//Using a class based component.
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class SampleComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // code to run on component mount
  }
render() {
    return (<div>foo</div>)
  }
}

//Using a functional component
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

const SampleComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    // code to run on component mount
  }, [])
return (<div>foo</div>)
}
export SampleComponent
```

**useEffect() Limitations**

When useEffect() is used to get data from server.

* The first argument is a callback that will be fired after browser layout and paint. Therefore it does not block the painting process of the browser.
* The second argument is an array of values (usually props).
* If any of the value in the array changes, the callback will be fired after every render.
* When it is not present, the callback will always be fired after every render.
* When it is an empty list, the callback will only be fired once, similar to componentDidMount.

#### Q. ***What do you understand by Refs in React? List some of the cases when you should use Refs?***

`Refs` provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. React Refs are a useful feature that act as a means to reference a DOM element or a class component from within a parent component.

Refs also provide some flexibility for referencing elements within a child component from a parent component, in the form of ref forwarding.

Example:
```javascript
class App extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props)
      // create a ref to store the textInput DOM element
      this.textInput = React.createRef();
      this.state = {
        value: ''
      }
    }
  
  // Set the state for the ref
  handleSubmit = e => {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.setState({ value: this.textInput.current.value})
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>React Ref - createRef</h1>
         {/** This is what will update **/}
        <h3>Value: {this.state.value}</h3>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          {/** Call the ref on <input> so we can use it to update the <h3> value **/}
          <input type="text" ref={this.textInput} />
          <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
**When to Use Refs**  

* Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
* Triggering imperative animations.
* Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.

**When not to use refs**  

* Should not be used with functional components because they dont have instances.
* Not to be used on things that can be done declaritvely.

#### Q. ***What will happen if you use setState() in constructor?***

When we use `setState()`, then apart from assigning to the object state react also rerenders the component and all it\'s children. Which we don\'t need in the constructor, since the component hasn\'t been rendered anyway.

Inside constructor uses `this.state = {}` directly, other places use `this.setState({ })`

Example:
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Food extends Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      fruits: ['apple', 'orange'],
      count: 0
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className = "container">
        <h2> Hello!!!</h2>
        <p> I have {this.state.count} fruit(s)</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

</div>

#### Q. ***Exlain is useCallback(), useMemo(), useImperativeHandle(), useLayoutEffect(), useDebugValue()  in React?***

#### Q. ***What is the difference between DOM and virtual DOM?***

1. **DOM**

DOM stands for "Document Object Model". The HTML DOM provides an interface (API) to traverse and modify the nodes. It contains methods like `getElementById()` or `removeChild()`.

The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. Because of that, the changes and updates to the DOM are fast. But after the change, the updated element and it\'s children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI. The re-rendering or re-painting of the UI is what makes it slow.

2. **Virtual DOM**  

The virtual DOM is only a virtual representation of the DOM. Everytime the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM.

The Virtual DOM is an abstraction of the HTML DOM. It is lightweight and detached from the browser-specific implementation details. Since the DOM itself was already an abstraction, the virtual DOM is, in fact, an abstraction of an abstraction.

* **Why Virtual DOM is faster**

When new elements are added to the UI, a virtual DOM, which is represented as a tree is created. Each element is a node on this tree. If the state of any of these elements changes, a new virtual DOM tree is created. This tree is then compared or “diffed” with the previous virtual DOM tree.

Once this is done, the virtual DOM calculates the best possible method to make these changes to the real DOM. This ensures that there are minimal operations on the real DOM. Hence, reducing the performance cost of updating the real DOM.

* **Pros of Virtual DOM**  

* Updates process is optimized and accelerated.
* JSX makes components/blocks code readable.
* React data binding establishes conditions for creation dynamic applications.
* Virtual DOM is ideal for mobile first applications.
* Prompt rendering. Using comprises methods to minimize number of DOM operations helps to optimize updating process and accelerate it.

#### Q. ***When should we use arrow functions with React?***

**Arrows prevent `this` bugs**

Arrow functions don not redefine the value of `this` within their function body. This makes it a lot easier to predict their behavior when passed as callbacks, and prevents bugs caused by use of this within callbacks. Using inline arrow functions in function components is a good way to achieve some decoupling.

Example:
```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick} style={this.state}>
        Set background to red
      </button>
    )
  }

  handleClick = () => {
    this.setState({ backgroundColor: 'red' })
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Button />,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
1. When we use `this` it generates a new function on every render, which will obviously have a new reference.
2. If the component we pass this generated function to is extending `PureComponent()`, it will not be able to bail out on rerendering, even if the actual data has not changed.

    <b><a href="#">↥ back to top</a></b>
</div>

#### Q. ***Differentiate between stateful and stateless components?***

Stateful and stateless components have many different names. They are also known as:

– Container vs Presentational components  
– Smart vs Dumb components  

The literal difference is that one has state, and the other does not. That means the stateful components are keeping track of changing data, while stateless components print out what is given to them via props, or they always render the same thing.

Example: Stateful/Container/Smart component
```js
class Main extends Component {
 constructor() {
   super()
   this.state = {
     books: []
   }
 }
 render() {
   <BooksList books={this.state.books} />
 }
}
```

Example: Stateless/Presentational/Dumb component
```js
const BooksList = ({books}) => {
 return (
   <ul>
     {books.map(book => {
       return <li>book</li>
     })}
   </ul>
 )
}
```
**Functional Component or Stateless component**  

* Functional component is like pure function in JavaScript.
* Functional component is also called as a stateless component.
* The functional component only receives props from parent component and return you JSX elements.
* The functional component doesn’t play with any lifecycle methods of React and doesn’t play with the component state.

**Class component or statefull component**  

* React class component is called as a stateful component.
* Stateful component plays with all life cycle methods of React.
* This component will modify state.

**When would you use a stateless component**

* When you just need to present the props
* When you do not need a state, or any internal variables
* When creating element does not need to be interactive
* When you want reusable code

**When would you use a stateful component?**  

* When building element that accepts user input or element that is interactive on page
* When dependent on state for rendering, such as, fetching data before rendering
* When dependent on any data that cannot be passed down as props

#### Q. ***What are the different phases of React component lifecycle?***

<img src="assets/react-lifecycle.png" alt="React component lifecycle" width="800px" />

React provides several methods that notify us when certain stage of this process occurs. These methods are called the component lifecycle methods and they are invoked in a predictable order. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases.

**1. Mounting**  

These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

* `constructor()`
* `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
* `render()`
* `componentDidMount()`

**constructor**  

The `constructor()` method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.

The `constructor()` method is called with the `props`, as arguments, and we should always start by calling the `super(props)` before anything else, this will initiate the parent\'s constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (`React.Component`).

**getDerivedStateFromProps**

The `getDerivedStateFromProps()` method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM. It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.

Example:
```js
class Color extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    return {color: props.favcol };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.color}</h1>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Color favcol="yellow"/>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**render()**

The render() method is required, and is the method that actual outputs HTML to the DOM.

**componentDidMount()**  

The `componentDidMount()` method is called after the component is rendered.

**2. Updating**  

The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated. A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component\'s state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

* `getDerivedStateFromProps()`
* `shouldComponentUpdate()`
* `render()`
* `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`
* `componentDidUpdate()`

**getDerivedStateFromProps**  

This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated. This is still the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.

Example:
```js
class Color extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    return {color: props.favcol };
  }
  changeColor = () => {
    this.setState({color: "blue"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.color}</h1>
      <button type="button" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change color</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Color favcol="yellow"/>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**shouldComponentUpdate**

In the `shouldComponentUpdate()` method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not. The default value is `true`.

```js
class Color extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate() {
    return false;
  }
  changeColor = () => {
    this.setState({color: "blue"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.color}</h1>
      <button type="button" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change color</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Color />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**render()**

The `render()` method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes.

**getSnapshotBeforeUpdate**

In the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` method we have access to the `props` and `state` before the update, meaning that even after the update, we can check what the values were before the update.

If the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` method is present, we should also include the `componentDidUpdate()` method, otherwise it will throw an error.

Example:
```js
class Color extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({color: "yellow"})
    }, 1000)
  }
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    document.getElementById("div1").innerHTML =
    "Before the update, the favorite was " + prevState.color;
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.getElementById("div2").innerHTML =
    "The updated favorite is " + this.state.color;
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.color}</h1>
        <div id="div1"></div>
        <div id="div2"></div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Color />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**componentDidUpdate**  

The `componentDidUpdate()` method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.

Example:
```js
class Color extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({color: "yellow"})
    }, 1000)
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.getElementById("mydiv").innerHTML =
    "The updated favorite is " + this.state.color;
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.color}</h1>
      <div id="mydiv"></div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Color />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**3. Unmounting**  

The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

* `componentWillUnmount()`

Example: Click the button to delete the header
```js
class Container extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {show: true};
  }
  delHeader = () => {
    this.setState({show: false});
  }
  render() {
    let myheader;
    if (this.state.show) {
      myheader = <Child />;
    };
    return (
      <div>
      {myheader}
      <button type="button" onClick={this.delHeader}>Delete Header</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class Child extends React.Component {
  componentWillUnmount() {
    alert("The component named Header is about to be unmounted.");
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Container />, document.getElementById('root'));

#### Q. ***What is the significance of keys in React?***

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

```js
function NumberList(props) {

  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

**Exceptions where it is safe to use index as key**

* If your list is static and will not change.
* The list will never be re-ordered.
* The list will not be filtered (adding/removing items from the list).
* There are no ids for the items in the list.

*Note: Using `index` as a key can lead to potential unexpected behaviour within the component.*

#### Q. ***What is React Router? Why is switch keyword used in React Router v4?***

React router implements a component-based approach to routing. It provides different routing components according to the needs of the application and platform. React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL. It has a simple API with powerful features like lazy loading, dynamic route matching, and location transition handling built right in.

```
npm install react-router-dom
```
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Router, Route, Redirect, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

import Todos from './components/Todos/Todos';
import TodosNew from './components/TodosNew/TodosNew';
import TodoShow from './components/TodoShow/TodoShow';

class Router extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <Router>
                <Switch>
                    <Route path='/todos/new' component={ TodosNew } />
                    <Route path='/todos/:id' component={ TodoShow } />
                    <Route exact path='/' component={ Todos } />
                    <Redirect from='*' to='/' />
                </Switch>
            </Router>
        );
    }
};

export default Router;
```

**`< Router />`**  

The `< Router />` component wraps our main application routing. Nested within Router will be all of our `< Route />` components, which will point to all other URLs.

**`<Switch />`**

The Switch component helps us to render the components only when path matches otherwise it fallbacks to the not found component. The `<Switch>` returns only one first matching route.

**exact**

The `exact` returns any number of routes that match exactly.

#### Q. ***Explain the standard JavaScript toolchain, transpilation (via Babel or other compilers), JSX, and these items significance in recent development?***

Typically, we use build tools like Grunt, Watchify/Browserify, Broccoli, or Webpack to watch the filesystem for file events (like when you add or edit a file). After this occurs, the build tool is configured to carry out a group of sequential or parallel tasks.

The rest of the tools belong in that group of sequential or parallel tasks:

* *Style linting* - typically a linter like JSCS is used to ensure the source code is following a certain structure and style
* *Dependency Management* - for JavaScript projects, most people use other packages from npm; some plugins exist for build systems (e.g. Webpack) and compilers (e.g. Babel) that allow automatic installation of packages being imported or require()‘d
* *Transpilation* - a specific sub-genre of compilation, transpilation involves compiling code from one source version to another, only to a similar runtime level (e.g. ES6 to ES5)
* *Compilation* - specifically separate from transpiling ES6 and JSX to ES5, is the act of including assets, processing CSS files as JSON, or other mechanisms that can load and inject external assets and code into a file. In addition, there are all sorts of build steps that can analyze your code and even optimize it for you.
* *Minification and Compression* - typically part of – but not exclusively controlled by – compilation, is the act of minifying and compressing a JS file into fewer and/or smaller files
* *Source-Mapping* - another optional part of compilation is building source maps, which help identify the line in the original source code that corresponds with the line in the output code (i.e. where an error occurred)
